        <dl>
            <dt>1. Nesting elements</dt>
            <dd>The elements have to open and close correctly, so they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap like above, then your web browser will try to make a best guess at what you were trying to say, and you may well get unexpected results. So don't do it!</dd>

            <dt>2. Empty elements</dt>
            <dd>Not all elements follow the above pattern of opening tag, content, closing tag. Some elements consist only of a single tag, which is usually used to insert/embed something in the document at the place it is included. For example, the &lt;img&gt; element embeds an image file onto a page in the position it is included in:</dd>

            <dt>3. Boolean attributes</dt>
            <dd>You'll sometimes see attributes written without values â€” this is perfectly allowed.</dd>

            <dt>4. Omitting quotes around attribute values</dt>
            <dd>Attribute value wituout quotes. This is allowable in certain circumstances, but will break your markup in others</dd>

            <dt>5. Single or double quotes?</dt>
            <dd>you can feel free to choose which one you prefer Single or double quote, but You should make sure you don't mix them together.</dd>
