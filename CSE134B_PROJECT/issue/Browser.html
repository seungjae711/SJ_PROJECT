                <dd><span>1)HTML fallback behaviour</span> <br>
                    Some problems can be solved by just taking advantage of the natural way in which HTML/CSS work. Unrecognised HTML elements are treated by the browser as anonymous inline elements.
                </dd> 
                <dd><span>2)CSS fallback behaviour</span><br>
                    If a browser encounters a declaration or rule it doesn't understand, it just skips it completely without applying it or throwing an error.
                </dd>
                <dd><span>3)IE conditional comments</span><br>
                    E conditional comments are a modified proprietary HTML comment syntax, which can be used to selectively apply HTML code to different versions of IE. This has proven to be a very effective mechanism for fixing cross browser bugs. 
                </dd>
                <dd><span>4)Selector support</span><br>
                    no CSS features will apply at all if you don't use the right selectors to select the element you want to style!

                <dd><span>1)Support for new layout features</span><br>
                        Much of the layout work on the web today is done using floats 
                </dd>
                <dd><span>2)Responsive design problems</span><br>
                    Responsive design is the practice of creating web layouts that change to suit different device form factors.
